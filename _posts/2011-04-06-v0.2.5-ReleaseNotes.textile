title: "v0.2.5 Release Notes: MSTest, Nuspec, Output, MSBuild, SQLCmd"
---

Albacore v0.2.5 has been pushed up to RubyGems.org. It contains one new task, mstest, and several additions and bug fixes for other tasks.

h2. MSTest

There have been a lot of requests for this task, and it's finally here thanks to Chris Geihsler! Check out the ["MSTest Task":https://github.com/derickbailey/Albacore/wiki/MSTest-Task] wiki page for documentation on how to use it.

h2. Additions And Bug Fixes

Several tasks have a few additions:

* Nuspec now has a .title attribute, to specify the title of your package. The title is uses by nuget.org and other package repositories.
* The Output task has a fix to require fileutils correctly
* MSBuild has a new .loggermodule attribute to specify a logger
* SQLCmd has a .severity option, now

h2. No Longer Tested With Ruby 1.8.6 Or Ruby 1.9.1

As stated in the previous release, we are no longer testing albacore against Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.9.1, from ["RubyInstaller.org":http://rubyinstaller.org]. Again, this does not mean that albacore will not work - only that we will not be fixing any bugs that arise due to these specific versions of ruby. You are encouraged to upgrade to ruby 1.8.7 or better yet, 1.9.2.
