title: "v0.3.0 Release Notes - Major Improvements from previous version"
---

Today we released version 0.3 of albacore. Improvements include:

 * A multitude of bugfixes and merges from pull requests

 * Better support for updated nuget binaries and their command line options

 * A new ILMerge task, no need to maintain your own now

 * Proper linux support again (no more erroring out from a broken 'require')

 * New build server (CI) - [travis-ci.org/Albacore/albacore](http://travis-ci.org/#!/Albacore/albacore/)

   This build server will continuously build your pull requests, to let you know if the specs are still
   passing.

 * A new MSDeploy task

 * New project github home: https://github.com/Albacore

 * New project documentation: https://github.com/Albacore/albacore/wiki

We're also happy to have [Anthony Mastrean](https://twitter.com/AnthonyMastrean) aboard.

As things are looking right now, the team consists of Henrik Feldt (@henrikfeldt) and
Anthony Mastrean (@anthonymastrean).

We'll be following up with a roadmap blog post.

Henrik and Anthony
